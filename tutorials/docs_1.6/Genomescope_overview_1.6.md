Genomescope plots overview
==========================
Based on Tanya Lama's [Interpreting GenomeScope profiles for VGP genome assemblies](https://hackmd.io/@tlama/Sk1HmluTH)

[GenomeScope](https://github.com/schatzlab/genomescope) is used to estimate the overall characteristics of a genome including genome size, heterozygosity rate and repeat content from unprocessed short reads using a kmer-based statistical approach.
