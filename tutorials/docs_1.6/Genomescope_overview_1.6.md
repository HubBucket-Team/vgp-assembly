GenomeScope plots overview
==========================
Based on [Interpreting GenomeScope profiles for VGP genome assemblies](https://hackmd.io/@tlama/Sk1HmluTH) by Tanya Lama.

[GenomeScope](https://github.com/schatzlab/genomescope) is used to estimate the overall characteristics of a genome including genome size, heterozygosity rate and repeat content from unprocessed short reads using a kmer-based statistical approach.
