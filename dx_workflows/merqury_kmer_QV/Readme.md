# merqury k-mer QV workflow
## Update note

**2020-Dec-18 update**
- found that issue on 2020-Nov-25 is AWS bad connection, so change instance type to mem1_ssd1_v2_x36 to fix issue. This would speed up running time and lower cost as well. Still keep only QV function to save money. 
- use new meryl_genomescope applet that has small DB size

**2020-Nov-25 update**
- use only QV function for merqury due to unknown bug for using full calculation

**2020-Oct-21 update**
