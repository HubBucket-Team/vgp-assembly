This apps generates a summary statistics for an assembly. Also accepts primary and alternate scaffolds.

Usage: ./asm_stats.sh <asm.fasta> <exp_genome_size (bp)> [p/c]
[p]: set for getting primary / alt haplotig stats, assuming the primary begins with scaffold_ in its name
[c]: set for getting scaffolds (direct sttas) only.

This is the source code for an app that runs on the DNAnexus Platform.
